This is a bash script I wrote for Ubuntu to install Plex Home Theater as an appliance. It will support LightDM or Systemd with the latter being the preferred method for a more simplistic and lightweight system.


TO-DO
- Switch to the OpenPHT fork
- Drop support for older versions of Ubuntu
- Support newer versions of Ubuntu
- Debian Support
